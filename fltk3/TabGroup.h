/**
  The Fl_Tabs widget is the "file card tabs"
  interface that allows you to put lots and lots of buttons and
  switches in a panel, as popularized by many toolkits.

  Clicking the tab makes a child visible() by calling
  show() on it, and all other children are made invisible
  by calling hide() on them. Usually the children are fltk3::Group widgets
  containing several widgets themselves.
  
  Each child makes a card, and its label() is printed
  on the card tab, including the label font and style.  The
  selection color of that child is used to color the tab, while
  the color of the child determines the background color of the pane.
  
  The size of the tabs is controlled by the bounding box of the
  children (there should be some space between the children and
  the edge of the Fl_Tabs), and the tabs may be placed
  "inverted" on the bottom - this is determined by which
  gap is larger. It is easiest to lay this out in fluid, using the
  fluid browser to select each child group and resize them until
  the tabs look the way you want them to.

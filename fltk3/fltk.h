	FL_F.  The highest possible number is FL_F_Last, so you
	can range-check a value.
    \li Buttons on the mouse are considered keys, and use the button
	number (where the left button is 1) plus FL_Button.
    \li All other keys on the keypad have a symbol: FL_Escape,
	FL_BackSpace, FL_Tab, FL_Enter, FL_Print, FL_Scroll_Lock, FL_Pause,
	FL_Insert, FL_Home, FL_Page_Up, FL_Delete, FL_End, FL_Page_Down,

    These functions support deletion of widgets inside callbacks.

    Fl::delete_widget() should be called when deleting widgets
    or complete widget trees (Fl_Group, Fl_Window, ...) inside
    callbacks.

    The other functions are intended for internal use. The preferred
    way to use them is by using the helper class Fl_Widget_Tracker.

    The following is to show how it works ...

    There are three groups of related methods:

      -# scheduled widget deletion
	- Fl::delete_widget() schedules widgets for deletion
	- Fl::do_widget_deletion() deletes all scheduled widgets
      -# widget watch list ("smart pointers")
	- Fl::watch_widget_pointer() adds a widget pointer to the watch list
	- Fl::release_widget_pointer() removes a widget pointer from the watch list
	- Fl::clear_widget_pointer() clears a widget pointer \e in the watch list
      -# the class Fl_Widget_Tracker:
	- the constructor calls Fl::watch_widget_pointer()
	- the destructor calls Fl::release_widget_pointer()
	- the access methods can be used to test, if a widget has been deleted
	  \see Fl_Widget_Tracker.

/**
  This class should be used to control safe widget deletion.

  You can use an Fl_Widget_Tracker object to watch another widget, if you
  need to know, if this widget has been deleted during a callback.

  This simplifies the use of the "safe widget deletion" methods
  Fl::watch_widget_pointer() and Fl::release_widget_pointer() and
  makes their use more reliable, because the destructor autmatically
  releases the widget pointer from the widget watch list.

  It is intended to be used as an automatic (local/stack) variable,
  such that the automatic destructor is called when the object's
  scope is left. This ensures that no stale widget pointers are
  left in the widget watch list (see example below).
  
  You can also create Fl_Widget_Tracker objects with \c new, but then it
  is your responsibility to delete the object (and thus remove the
  widget pointer from the watch list) when it is not needed any more.

  Example:

  \code
    int MyClass::handle (int event) {

      if (...) {
	Fl_Widget_Tracker wp(this);	// watch myself
	do_callback();			// call the callback

	if (wp.deleted()) return 1;	// exit, if deleted

	// Now we are sure that the widget has not been deleted.
	// It is safe to access the widget

	clear_changed();		// access the widget
      }
    }
  \endcode

/**
  This class should be used to control safe widget deletion.

  You can use an Fl_Widget_Tracker object to watch another widget, if you
  need to know, if this widget has been deleted during a callback.

  This simplifies the use of the "safe widget deletion" methods
  Fl::watch_widget_pointer() and Fl::release_widget_pointer() and
  makes their use more reliable, because the destructor autmatically
  releases the widget pointer from the widget watch list.

  It is intended to be used as an automatic (local/stack) variable,
  such that the automatic destructor is called when the object's
  scope is left. This ensures that no stale widget pointers are
  left in the widget watch list (see example below).
  
  You can also create Fl_Widget_Tracker objects with \c new, but then it
  is your responsibility to delete the object (and thus remove the
  widget pointer from the watch list) when it is not needed any more.

  Example:

  \code
    int MyClass::handle (int event) {

      if (...) {
	Fl_Widget_Tracker wp(this);	// watch myself
	do_callback();			// call the callback

	if (wp.deleted()) return 1;	// exit, if deleted

	// Now we are sure that the widget has not been deleted.
	// It is safe to access the widget

	clear_changed();		// access the widget
      }
    }
  \endcode
